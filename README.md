# Transmitting Images Using Audio Waveforms

MATLAB code to simulate the transmission of images using audio waveforms.

The following topics from digital signal processing were used:
<ol>
  <li>Discrete Fourier Transform (`fft()` in MATLAB)</li>
  <li>Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (`ifft()` in MATLAB)</li>
  <li>Gaussian noise to simulate a wireless channel (`randn()` in MATLAB)</li>
  <li>Wiener filter for image post-processing (`wiener2()` in MATLAB)</li>
</ol>
